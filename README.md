A first hands-on experience with HTML, CSS and JS. This project is based on my personal interest and for learning purpose. 

Improvements pending:
1. The image hover pop-ups of "Love, Build, Grow" changes position depending on the browser's window size and hides the subtitle. Make it anchored and resize the images depending on the viewport size.
2. For hero iamges container of the main themes (e.g. LOVE), when the image scales, it overlays the titles below. Separate it.
3. For the YT video, padding-top doesn't work despite code implementation.
4. For the lyrics container, unable to align a bit further left.
5. Should flex be applied to .video along with .video-container and .lyric-container?
